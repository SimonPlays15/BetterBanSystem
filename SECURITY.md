# Security Policy

</span>

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously. If you have discovered a security issue with our plugin, we **appreciate** your help in
disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

#### DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE

Do not create a **GitHub** issue if you find a security vulnerability. GitHub's issues are _public_, and it would
publicly
disclose the vulnerability.

#### Reporting

Instead, contact us directly at our Discord Server [MCDevStudios](https://discord.gg/QWpsnKPC8W). We'll work with you to
make
sure we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern. If necessary we will create a GitHub
security advisory.

Thank you for your work, we appreciate your efforts in improving our community.
